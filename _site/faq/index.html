  <div class="faq">
    <h2>What is Highland Portraits?</h2>

    <p>Highland Portraits is a photo studio based in Berkeley CA specializing in headshots for businesses, non-profits, and academic institutions. It was launched in March 2015 by the photographer <a href="//www.mattlwong.com">Matt L. Wong</a>. The philosophy behind Highland Portraits is that every person deserves the opportunity to be photographed beautifully, as pictures have become an integral component of our personal identity in the digital age.</p>

    <h2> How do I book a session? </h2>

    <p> To book your solo portrait session, simply click <a href="/book-now">BOOK NOW</a>, then select a date and time that works best. Next, read and sign the Portrait Agreement form. To reserve your slot, you will need to pay a non-refundable $25 retainer. This secures your time slot. Shortly afterward you will receive an email confirmation from the photographer with information about how to prepare for your session.</p>

    <h2>Can my company request professional headshots?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely. If you wish to request headshots for your company's team, please <a href="/contact">CONTACT</a> us directly and we will send you a personalized quote. Rates depend on location, number of people involved, and ambient conditions (see <a href="/services">HERE</a> for current rates).</p>

    <h2>What can I expect from my Solo Portrait Session?</h2>

    <p>A solo portrait session includes 45 minutes with the photographer with two wardrobe changes and your choice of canvas or paper backdrop (learn more <a href="/services">HERE</a>). A cup of coffee or tea is typically provided for the guest. To see our selection of paper and canvas backdrops press <a href="/services">HERE</a> for color coordination.</p>

    <h2>How will I choose my favorite portraits?</h2>

    <p>After your session, you will have the opportunity to review all the images immediately and select your final images for retouching. The photographer will offer his professional recommendation for the best two shots. If you need more time and would like to share with your friends and family, we can send you low-resolution copies at no additional cost for you to consider at your own pace, but be advised this may increase the time before which you will receive your final retouched images.</p>

    <p>For groups, each team member will have the opportunity to review her images and choose the picture that she prefers, unless the team director opts for the photographer and art director to make that decision.</p>

    <h2>How do I receive my final images?</h2>

    <p>Final images are sent through cloud storage in full resolution (300dpi JPG format), which is suitable for printing and commercial branding purposes. Also included are the compressed files (72dpi), which are best for web design and social media.</p>

    <h2>I donâ€™t feel very photogenic, what can you do to make me look better on camera?</h2>

    <p>I hear this quite often. Fortunately, I have developed some techniques to allay the anxiety of being in front of the camera. My approach to portrait photography focuses on communication and gradual desensitization to the camera. I offer coaching during the portrait session to relieve the stress of being in front of the camera. I can also share images in real-time so you can observe yourself and consider how to adjust your expression and posture. Many people who are typically afraid of the camera have commented on how smooth the process went for them. Read more <a href="/about">HERE</a>.</p>

    <h2>What makes you different from other photographers?</h2>

    <p>My experience, attention to detail, equipment, technique, and selection of interesting backdrops define my style. Like the photographer Annie Leibovitz, I use hand-painted canvases (inspired by <a href="www.oliphantstudio.com/">Oliphant Studios</a>) to create more evocative, painterly images. But what singularly distiguishes me from most portraits photographers is that I am patient and will work with each client to produce a satisfying final image. I think it's worth the extra effort to get you a picture that you're happy with and want to use in your every day life. I see portrait photography as a means of helping people achieve confidence and sending a positive message to new clients.</p>

    <p>After the photo session, I use advanced post-processing techniques to enhance your final images. I adjust color and contrast, background details, shadow elimination, and gentle retouching of the eyes, teeth, and skin.</p>

    <h2>Can I order more than two images?</h2>

    <p>Definitely! You can order as many images as you wish. Each additional retouched image is $100, although discounts can be made in larger requests.</p>

    <h2>How soon can I expect my final images?</h2>

    <p>Your final edited professional portraits of your choice will be made privately within seven days via a confidential cloud storage. I will make every effort to get you the final images as quickly as possible.</p>

    <h2>Why do I need a professional headshot?</h2>

    <p>In our age of social media and digital communication, image has never been more important. Projecting a strong image has become almost a necessity in many client-oriented professions. Pictures convey meaning, trust, and emotional content in ways that words simply cannot. Indeed, our pictures are often the first thing potential clients see when assessing your brand or product, so it is a good idea to invest in strong imagery to complement your technical skills and personality.</p>

    <h2>What types of people do you specialize in photographing?</h2>

    <p>Over the past three years I've photographed physicians, lawyers, computer programmers, therapists, doctoral students, entrepreneurs, consultants, actors, models, and just about anybody in need of a portrait for their business or personal lives. In addition to professional portraits, some clients ask me if I can take pictures for personal purposes, which is an assignment I am readily happy to oblige.</p>
