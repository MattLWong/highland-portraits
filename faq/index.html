    <h2 class="accordion"> How do I book a session? </h2>

    <div class="panel"><p> To book, simply click <a href="/book-now">BOOK NOW</a>, then select a date and time that works best. To reserve your slot, you may be asked pay a non-refundable $50 retainer. This secures your time slot. Shortly afterward you will receive an email confirmation with information about how to prepare for your session.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">Can my company request professional headshots?</h2>
    <div class="panel"><p>Yes. If you wish to request headshots for your company's team, please <a href="/contact">CONTACT</a> us directly and we will send you a quote based on your location, number of people involved, and ambient lighting conditions (see <a href="/services">HERE</a> for current rates).</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">Why do I need a professional headshot?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>In our world of social media and smartphones, pictures have never been more prevalent. We are saturated by images of our friends and colleagues, whether it's on Facebook or LinkedIn. Projecting a strong, approachable image has become a necessity when selling your personal brand, whether you're a rising real estate agent or molecular biologist. Pictures help convey meaning, trust, and emotional content in ways that words simply cannot. It would be a good idea to invest in imagery that complements your "soft" and "hard" skills, regardless of your chosen profession. </p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">What can I expect from my portrait session?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>A solo portrait session includes 50 minutes with the photographer with two wardrobe changes and your choice of canvas or paper backdrop (learn more <a href="/services">HERE</a>). To see our selection of paper and canvas backdrops press <a href="/services">HERE</a> for color coordination. The photographer also guides you so you feel at ease in front of the camera, no matter how camera shy you are.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">How will I choose my favorite portraits?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>After your session, you will have the opportunity to review all the images immediately and select your final images for retouching. The photographer will offer his recommendation for the strongest shots. If you need more time and would like to share with your friends and family, we can send you low-resolution copies at no additional cost for you to consider at your own pace, but be advised this may increase the time before which you will receive your retouched images.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">How do I receive my final images?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>Final images are sent through the cloud in full resolution (300dpi JPG format), which is suitable for printing and commercial branding purposes. Also included are the compressed files (72dpi), which are best for web design and social media.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">I donâ€™t feel very photogenic, what can you do to make me look better on camera?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>I hear this quite often, but you have no need to worry. My approach to photography focuses on effective communication and slowly guiding you to be comfortable in front of the camera. I provide live expressive coaching during the session to relieve the anxiety of being in front of the camera. People who generally don't enjoy being photographed have commented before how smoothly the process went for them. Read their testimonials <a href="/about">HERE</a>.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">What makes you different from other local photographers?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>With three years of experience as a portrait photographer, my attention to detail, lighting techniques, and selection of interesting backdrops help to define my style. Like Annie Leibovitz, I utilize hand-painted canvases, inspired by <a href="www.oliphantstudio.com/">Oliphant Studios</a>, to create evocative and stylish images. But what distiguishes me from most other photographers is that I am patient and will work with each client to find a satisfying final image that works. I'm passionate about making people feel satisfied by their personal image.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">Can I order more than two images?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>Yes. You can order as many images as you wish. Each additional retouched image is $100, although discounts can be made for larger requests.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">How soon can I expect my final images?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>Your final edited professional portraits of your choice will be made privately within seven days via a confidential cloud storage. I will make every effort to get you the final images as quickly as possible.</p></div>


    <h2 class="accordion">What types of people do you specialize in photographing?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>Over the past three years I've photographed physicians, lawyers, computer programmers, actors, therapists, doctoral students, entrepreneurs, consultants, actors, models, and just about anybody in need of a portrait for their business or personal lives. In addition to professional portraits, some clients ask me if I can take pictures for personal purposes, which I am readily happy to oblige.</p></div>
