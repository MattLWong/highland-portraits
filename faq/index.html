    </div>

    <h2 class="accordion"> How do I book my session? </h2>

    <div class="panel"><p> To book, simply click <a href="/book-now">BOOK NOW</a>, then select a date and time that works best. To reserve your slot, you may be asked pay a non-refundable $25 retainer. This secures your time slot. Shortly afterward you will receive an email confirmation with information about how to prepare for your session.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">Can my company request professional headshots?</h2>
    <div class="panel"><p>Absolutely. If you wish to request headshots for your company's team, please <a href="/contact">CONTACT</a> us directly and we will send you a quote. Rates depend on location, number of people involved, and ambient conditions (see <a href="/services">HERE</a> for current rates).</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">Why do I need a professional headshot?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>In today's world of social media and high-speed internet, pictures have never been more important. We are surrounded by images of our friends and colleagues. Projecting a strong image has almost become a necessity in client-oriented professions. Pictures convey meaning, trust, and emotional content in ways that words simply cannot. Indeed, our pictures are often the first thing potential clients see when assessing your brand or product. It would be wise to invest in strong imagery to complement your technical skills and personality, regardless of your profession.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">What can I expect from my solo portrait session?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>A solo portrait session includes 45-50 minutes with the photographer with two wardrobe changes and your choice of canvas or paper backdrop (learn more <a href="/services">HERE</a>). To see our selection of paper and canvas backdrops press <a href="/services">HERE</a> for color coordination.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">How will I choose my favorite portraits?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>After your session, you will have the opportunity to review all the images immediately and select your final images for retouching. The photographer will offer his professional recommendation for the best two shots. If you need more time and would like to share with your friends and family, we can send you low-resolution copies at no additional cost for you to consider at your own pace, but be advised this may increase the time before which you will receive your final retouched images.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">How do I receive my final images?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>Final images are sent through cloud storage in full resolution (300dpi JPG format), which is suitable for printing and commercial branding purposes. Also included are the compressed files (72dpi), which are best for web design and social media.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">I donâ€™t feel very photogenic, what can you do to make me look better on camera?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>No worries, and I hear this quite often. My approach to portrait photography focuses on effective communication and bringing out the subject's personality. I provide on-site coaching during the portrait session to relieve the anxiety of being in front of the camera. Many people who don't like being photographed have commented on how smooth the process went for them. Read my testimonials <a href="/about">HERE</a>.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">What makes you different from other local photographers?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>With three years of experience as a portrait photographer, my attention to detail, lighting technique, and selection of interesting backdrops help to define my style. Like Annie Leibovitz, I utilize hand-painted canvases, inspired by <a href="www.oliphantstudio.com/">Oliphant Studios</a>, to create more evocative images. But what distiguishes me from most other photographers is that I am patient and will work with each client to find a satisfying final image. I'm passionate about making people feel good about how they look on camera.</p>

    <p>After the photo session, I enhance your final images by adjusting color contrast, background details, shadows, and gentle retouching of the eyes, teeth, and skin.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">Can I order more than two images?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>Definitely. You can order as many images as you wish. Each additional retouched image is $100, although discounts can be made for larger requests.</p></div>

    <h2 class="accordion">How soon can I expect my final images?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>Your final edited professional portraits of your choice will be made privately within seven days via a confidential cloud storage. I will make every effort to get you the final images as quickly as possible.</p></div>


    <h2 class="accordion">What types of people do you specialize in photographing?</h2>

    <div class="panel"><p>I cater to a wide range of professionals. In the past three years I've photographed physicians, lawyers, computer programmers, therapists, doctoral students, entrepreneurs, consultants, actors, models, and just about anybody in need of a portrait for their business or personal lives. In addition to professional portraits, some clients ask me if I can take pictures for personal purposes, which I am readily happy to oblige.</p></div>
